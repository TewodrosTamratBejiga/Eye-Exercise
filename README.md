# Eye-Exercise
## Descrition
This project is designed for exploring what is possible when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to create this dynamic experience. Accordingly, the main task was to create a web page with two eyes that follow a mouse movement. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events.
